        <h2>PARENTS</h2>
        <p>My parents mean everything to me—they're my biggest cheerleaders, my teachers, and my role models. My dad is the type of guy who works hard and never complains, always making sure we have what we need. He has this calm, steady presence that gives me the feeling that everything will be alright, no matter what happens. Plus, he's got a fantastic sense of humor—he really knows how to lighten the mood when things get a bit tense. He’s the one who taught me to keep moving forward, even when things get tough, and to always choose the right path, no matter how difficult it may be. My mom, on the flip side, is the heart of our family. She makes everything feel warm and safe. Even when she's super busy, she manages to find time to listen, comfort, and offer advice that somehow always hits the mark. She’s incredibly strong, even if she sometimes doesn’t see it herself, and she knows how to juggle everything while putting others first. Her kindness and patience truly inspire me, and I hope I can be even half as compassionate as she is. Together, they create a home full of love, laughter, and support. They aren't perfect—who is?—but they are everything I could ever wish for in parents. I can’t express how grateful I am for them, and I hope they always realize how much I appreciate all they do..</p>
