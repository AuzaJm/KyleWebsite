            <h2>PROFILE</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Kyle Nicole Veñegas, a Grade 10 student of SPA Shakespeare. I am currently 16 years old and will be turning 17 on August 31. I live in Cubay Sermon, Sibalom, Antique.</p>
            <p>To introduce myself and share about my life, let's begin at the very start. I was born at Pasong Birthing Clinic, Sibalom Antique, on August 31, 2008. I studied elementary at Sibalom Central Elementary School, and my elementary years were fun and exciting until the pandemic came in the middle of my Grade 5 class and lasted until I was in Grade 7. During this challenging time, it was difficult to go out due to the risk of exposure to viruses. Studying online was a bit difficult for me because I could not socialize and experience my Grade 6 graduation and my first day of junior high school.</p>
            <p>However, one positive outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic was that I discovered my passion for dancing while staying at home—not too well, but not too bad either. After graduating from elementary school, I enrolled at Antique National School as an SPA student majoring in dance. That's how my life has been, and now I am in my last year as an SPA student and still enjoying dancing.</p>
